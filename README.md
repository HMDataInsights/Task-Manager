# Task Manager
### Description
This project is a task management application that allows users to keep track of their tasks, assignments and deadlines. The project uses the task_manager.py file and the accompanying supporting text files (user.txt and tasks.txt). The main functionality of the program includes registering a user, adding tasks, viewing all tasks and viewing a specific user's tasks. The code has been refactored to include functions for abstraction and has added features such as error checking for duplicate usernames and the option to edit and mark tasks as complete. The program also generates reports that can be viewed in the application.
